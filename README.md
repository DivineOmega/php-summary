# PHP Summary

A PHP library to automatically summarise text using a naive summerisation algorithm.

This summerisation algorithm in use takes the key sentence from each paragraph. It then strings these resulting sentences together to form to summary.

For more details on this algorithm, see this [blog post by Shlomi Babluki](http://thetokenizer.com/2013/04/28/build-your-own-summary-tool/).

## Installation

Require this package, with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), in the root directory of your project.

```bash
composer require divineomega/php-summary
```
